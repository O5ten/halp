<H1>Data Behaviour</H1>

In the profiling tab, when you have selected data you wish to profile you can see a list with the headline "expected behaviour".
This is the application asking you, the user, to suggest what type of data the selected data is.
The application can guess it, but that is currently in a stage of development so input is the best bet until the guessing algorithm is in place.
Below follows a short description on what each type of data means and how it might be automatically correlated as soon as profiling is in place.<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Garbage Collection:</H2>
<HR>
 This pattern has regular and BIG sudden changes.<BR>
 they should not be detected as changes, however, if this data stops changing regularly then we have a problem.<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Throughput</H2>
<HR>
 A value that can change drastically as the number of users increase or decreases.<BR>
 Should almost always be correlated to a FIXED rate or MovingRate.<BR>
 If there is a big change in a fixed or moving rate at the same time as Throughput then this lessens the importance of the alarm.<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Memory</H2>
<HR>
 Fast on startup, slow changes when steady state reached.<BR>
 Alarm should be raised if this seldom or never decreases.<BR>
 I.E if there is a memory leak.<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Accumulative</H2>
<HR>
 Number of completed transactions, counters of the many sorts.<BR>
 Alarm should be raised if they suddenly stop compared to a pattern.<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Average</H2>
<HR>
 Like troughput it coincides with rates and other similar systems.<BR>
 A difference is that the filter should be more forgiving as averages move<BR>
 continuously while throughput moves more seldom but spikes more often.<BR>
 Average is continuous but without the same spiking as TP.<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Rate</H2>
<HR>
 A rate, let's say a sending-rate of a fixed number of requests per seconds.<BR>
 Seldom changes, and when it does it shouldn't really trigger any alarms as it is likely user or tester inflicted.<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Moving Rate</H2>
<HR>
 A rate that moves with time, let's say a linear increase, in correlation to this rate not<BR>
 changing drastically then an alarm at a TP stat that does change drastically is more definite.<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Zero</H2>
<HR>
 Statistic is and should be Zero in the best case scenario, examples are dropped messages, discarded messages<BR>
 404 Resource cannot be found, 500 Internal Server Error,<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Time</H2>
<HR>
 Time taken to get a response, fluctuates a'lot when it eventually moves at all. Highly relevant for the peak profile<BR>
 Good to correlate to Rate.<BR>
<BR>
<H2>CPU</H2>
<HR>
A very specific measurement that fluctuates much and often. If it lingers on very high very long then there is a need for an alarm.<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Unknown</H2>
<HR>
 A timestamp for example or something that does not imply anything of importance<BR>
 like number of valid responses or timestamps or similar. I.E, this does not get measured or correlated unless explicitly specified.<BR>
