<H1>What are we trying to do?</H1>

This, is an application built for testing. <BR>
The purpose of this application is to reject the idea that using adaptive filters and change detectors as profiling for<BR>
performance testing tools does not give any assistance for an inexperienced performance tester. <BR>
The application is built as a proof-of-concept to motivate building such a feature within an already existing performance testing tool<BR>
The core libraries that are used can then hopefully be applied to that tool to simplify the implementation of the same. <BR>
