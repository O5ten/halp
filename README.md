#HALP

Application for testing the idea of heuristic assistance for a performance testing tool.
The point is to see how useful adaptive filters and change detectors can be in that type of app.

##Why
This project was developed as part of a masters thesis and it only reads csv-files and puts the data into a simple interface, as that was the requirement. Different profilers use metrics from performance tests to correlate between different statistics to give stronger suggestions.
